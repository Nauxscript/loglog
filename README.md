# loglog

(ä¸­æ–‡)[./README_zh.md] | (English)[./README.md]

An interesting little application.

One of my good friends has a habit of recording each day's events with a short (one-sentence) statement.

The reason he sticks to this habit is:

He feels that after graduating from college and starting to work, it seems like every day passes by quickly;

So much so that for a while, he often couldn't remember what happened on a certain day (actually, most people probably wouldn't remember);

So he started this habit.

With such statements, flipping through the recorded logs on a certain day,

Perhaps you can roughly pick up some fragments of memories from a certain year, month, and day.

I was touched after hearing this, and thus came up with the idea of â€‹â€‹such a small application.

I see this behavior as inputting logs into a running process;

Record everything that happens with our own "service" anytime and anywhere.

Perhaps you are a "lively service," so lively that you are even outputting your heartbeat logs every moment;

Or maybe you are a "silent service," only outputting a log every three to five months.

So what? It's just a log.

> Of course, this small application is actually just an MVP, but it is my (first) complete implementation project in learning Web3 (contracts, deployment, interaction, etc.)
> For me, the perfect LogLog application should be able to "log" anytime and anywhere, without the need to open a webpage or an app or any other cumbersome process, but the simpler the better.
> So, looking forward to the next form of LogLog? ðŸ¤ª
